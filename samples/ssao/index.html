			<h2>Screen-Space Ambient Occlusion</h2>

			<p>A really simplified description of ambient occlusion would be: the more
			occluded by nearby geometry a surface is, the less ambient light it's likely to receive.
			For instance, a flat surface will receive any ray of light comming to it, whereas
			the interior of a cylinder will only receive light coming from its opening.</p>

			<p>In real-time this effect can be reproduced using the depth buffer
			to reconstruct an approximation of the geometry around shaded fragments.</p>

			<p>The algorithm used here is a really inefficient / na√Øve implementation
			of the Crytek method, which is explained
			<a href="http://john-chapman-graphics.blogspot.fr/2013/01/ssao-tutorial.html">here</a>,
			and in more details in the book <i>Shader X<sup>7</sup> (page 411)</i>.</p>

			<p>Here is roughly how it works. For each fragment:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>recreate the fragment's position in view space</li>
				<li>create random samples in a sphere around this view space position</li>
				<li>project the samples, and check if they are behind the depth stored in the buffer</li>
			</ul>

			<p>Depending on the number of samples which are visible, we have our approximation of the
			ambient occlusion term.</p>

			<p>This method suffers from many artefacts. The 2 main ones are:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>sampling in a sphere instead of an hemisphere makes a perfectly flat surface half
				occluded</li>
				<li>approximating the geometry from the depth buffer introduces errors du to depth
				discontinuities</li>
			</ul>

			<p>The first problem can be fixed using a more advanced sampling method. Such methods are
			described in the link provided, and also in the <i>Shader X<sup>7</sup></i> book, but since
			it requires normals, I'll wait for <i>drawBuffers</i> support in WebGL to test it.</p>

			<p>The second problem is mostly adressed by taking depth gaps into account when computing
			the AO term and blurring the result.</p>

			<h3>Controls</h3>
			<ul>
				<li><b>left click:</b> rotate the camera around the focus point.</li>
				<li><b>middle click:</b> move the focus point in a screen aligned plane.</li>
				<li><b>right click:</b> zoom in / out.</li>
			</ul>
